      <description>Goeff Hinton recently tweeted [1] a question that got me thinking. At first blush, explainability sounds fantastic, and to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m pro-explainability. However, he poses an interesting thought - if a model, algorithm, or automated surgeon is more accurate than the prior human-run decision, does it matter if we can explain?
After an initial positive reaction (If I had cancer, I&amp;rsquo;d choose the more accurate option and not question decisions made to get the cure), I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to questioning what happens when things go wrong.</description>
